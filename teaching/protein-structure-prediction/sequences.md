Biologists are working hard to provide as soon as possible the sequencing of your two strains! They should be available next week.



<!--

Please find here the Illumina sequencing data of your two [strains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)): [download page](https://filesender.renater.fr/?s=download&token=f10acd21-afd6-4146-b15a-b79839445a64)

Please do your best to find why this strain is resistant!
